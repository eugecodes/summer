Intriguing proposition

What is the difference between what we do and what something like an elastic search?

From a reporting perspective, much of their limitations

Looking and evaluating platforms for reporting solutions. Looking for things from a BI perspective.

Not terribly scalable or performant on their growing datasets.
That is their biggest challenge today.

What do they currently use?
Microstrategy

Combo of 2 problems:
Query engines are super slow
  optimizing their queries

Limitation of architecture of Microstrategy

Cost of the solution itself is prohibitive b/c it doesn't scale.


They are resolving the query issues in house. They are looking for a new visualization platform.

A more cost effective, and easier to manage reporting solution. Something that is easier to scale with.

Looking for a solution that is database agnostic and able to scale out horizontally. Moving into
a significant growth period.

Going to need to be able to scale with and expand with their data needs. Internationally and domestically.

Roughly 1PB. In 12-18 months should double or more based on current trends and growth expectations.

Data Visualization Tools They're looking at:
  Jaspersoft
  Few others
  Close to landing on a solution and just took a step back for a bit.
